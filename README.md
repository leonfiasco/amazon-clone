# Amazon clone app

I built this app with help of a tutorial but added some extra features of my own to it, The reason I built this was to get to grips with creating an e-commerce website and using online payment methods such as Stripe and I wanted to experiment with another database and Firebase was the one I chose

## Technologies

React, React context-api, Nodejs, Expressjs, Firebase, axios, stripe payments


## Future features



## Questions I will look into
Is the customers details all the way safe from hackers
How can I notfify the seller once an order has been placed 
Is there a cms that works with React that the seller can use to update their products/ or will I have to use something like wordpress/shopify
